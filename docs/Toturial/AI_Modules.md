QUESTIONS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
AI Provider: Which AI service are you using?

OpenAI API (GPT-4)?
Azure OpenAI?
Already configured somewhere in the project?
If not configured, I need API key + endpoint
AI Prompt Strategy: For the AI grading helper, I'll use this prompt pattern:

Does this look right? Any adjustments?

Grading page location: Can you tell me the exact route/file path of the existing grading page so I can integrate the rubric display + AI helper into it?

Bilingual AI grading: Should AI grade based on the language the candidate answered in? Or always English?

Once confirmed I start implementation immediately.
